# CABO_SVH_Forest_Sites

This repository is meant to support the manuscript: 
"Linking aerial hyperspectral data to canopy tree biodiversity: an examination of the spectral variation hypothesis" by Crofts et al. in prep. 

This study is apart of the larger Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory (http://caboscience.org/) initiative.

# Components
The repository contains an R script composed of three sections:
1. The Degree of Correspondence Analsyses (ie., the relationship between spectral and field-based community properites)
- Composition: procrustes and pearson's correlations
- Diversity: pearson's correlations
2. Environmental Drivers of Community Properites
- Composition: redundancy analyses
- Diversity: general additive models
3. Supporting Figures
- Study site figure
- Spurious northness effects
- Wavelengths contributing to spectral diversity
4. Preliminary Analysis looking at degree of correspondence using fused, full spectrum
- Composition: procrustes and pearson's correlations
- Diversity: pearson's correlations
- 
# How to use
This repository is meant to be a reasonably well-documented record of the analyses carried out in the manuscript detailed above. 

# Associated data products
Upon acceptance associated data will be made publically archieved in the Ecological Spectral Information System (EcoSIS) repository.
